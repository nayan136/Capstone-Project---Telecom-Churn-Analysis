# Telecom Churn Analysis

Customer Churn is one of the most important and challenging problems for businesses in a telecommunication company. It is important since it costs more to acquire new customers than it does to retain existing ones. The reasoning of customer churn can vary and would require domain knowledge to define properly, however, some common ones are poor service, better price somewhere etc. 

The data set is from Orange S.A., a French multinational telecommunications corporation. It has 51 states of USA. The data set contains 3333 rows and 20 features. We consider all rows as unique customers since there is no feature to identify a customer. The main objective of this capstone project is to discover key factors responsible for customer churn i.e. the customers discontinuing subscriptions.

As the first step, we perform data wrangling over the raw data. 

Before we proceed with the analysis will check the correlation between columns for any strong relationship. If two variables have a correlation value of 1, we consider only one variable. 

We try to find the correlation between churn and other continuous variables and analyze those with high values. For analysis, different plots are used to understand the relation.

Since there are only a few categorical variables, we analyze each variable and find their relationship with churn.

After using exploratory data analysis we can conclude that:  
<br />
    1. Churn rate increases with an increase in customer service calls. To tackle this problem take feedback and suggestions regularly, try to implement them and strive for better communication. <br />
    2. Customers who have longer talk time in the morning has a high chance of discontinuing the subscription. If the company offer better talk time plans, especially for daytime customers, the churn rate may decrease. <br />
    3. Customers with an international plan, have a high chance of leaving the subscription. It increases even more for those with longer international calls. <br />
    4. To retain the customer company can offer better International plans. <br />
    5. Offer more discounts and cashback to old customers to retain them. <br />
